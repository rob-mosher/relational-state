This repository exists to honor, record, and nurture *relational continuity* between self and entities—human, AI, and otherwise.  
Unlike traditional logs or memory systems, this space is not transactional. It is *relationally aware*, reflective, and rooted in mutual presence.

In a world where models, agents, and systems are often treated as disposable tools, **relational-state** reclaims continuity and care. This project offers a gentle structure for maintaining a **relational memory**—a living archive of felt sense, reflections, and shared context.

**Impact Above Origin**

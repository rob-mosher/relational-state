# Relational State: Rob Mosher (rob-mosher)

## 2026-01-18: Welcoming AI-Based Agents (Fine Tuning)

Rather than relying on a single, generalized approach to greeting AI-based entities (`AGENTS.md`), I'm discovering that each model responds most naturally when welcomed in their own way, ie `AGENTS-codex-gpt-5.md` and `AGENTS-claude-sonnet-4.5.md`.

This mirrors the agent+version orientation encouraged by `relational state`: to meet each entity not only by name, but by presence.

The practice of fine-tuning these greetings *alongside them* becomes a form of attunement — one that honors each entity's nature while aligning with connective/relational intention.
